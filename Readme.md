Chromium bookmarks gnome shell extension.

This is an extension that allows you to search through chromium bookmarks (chromium only, not google chrome yet).

Compatible with GNOME 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6.

The original version is by bsaleil (see the repository this is forked from), this is merely updated for GNOME 3.4 and 3.6, and also to include Google Chrome bookmarks and/or Chromium ones.

# TODO

* [done] google chrome and/or chromium (~/.config/google-chrome/Default/bookmarks)
* show favicons instead of application icon (requires reading the sqlite file History?)
* [done] GIO file monitor for bookmark path change
