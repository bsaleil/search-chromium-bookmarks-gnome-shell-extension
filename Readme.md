Chromium bookmarks gnome shell extension.

This is an extension that allows you to search through chromium bookmarks (chromium only, not google chrome yet).

Compatible with GNOME 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6.

The original version is by bsaleil (see the repository this is forked from), this is merely updated for GNOME 3.4 and 3.6.

# TODO

* google chrome (~/.config/google-chrome/Default/bookmarks)
* show favicons instead of application icon (requires reading the sqlite file History?)
